This repository contains the source code for **FindMySpot**, an embedded C project aimed at providing a parking spot booking solution. The app allows users to book, track, and manage parking spots efficiently using an embedded system. The project is designed to streamline the parking process by offering an intuitive interface and real-time spot availability updates.
Iâ€™ve shared more about this project on LinkedIn. You can view the post [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ankurrajsahu_embeddedsystems-iot-arduino-activity-7233725665357832193-MLX7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) for further details and updates!

## Features

- **Parking Spot Booking**: Users can search for available parking spots and reserve them in real-time.
- **Real-Time Availability**: The system updates the availability of parking spots dynamically.
- **Booking Confirmation**: Users receive confirmation of their booking.
- **Cancellation**: Ability to cancel a reserved spot if no longer needed.
- **Embedded System Integration**: The project is implemented using Embedded C for microcontroller-based systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Embedded C**: Core logic and communication with the hardware.
- **Microcontroller**: The application is designed to run on a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, STM32).
- **LCD Display**: User interface through a simple display for booking and managing parking.
- **Keypad Input**: Allows users to input information for booking.
- **Sensors**: For detecting parking spot availability (e.g., using IR or ultrasonic sensors).
